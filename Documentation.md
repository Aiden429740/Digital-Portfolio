# Targetted Audience
Employers, I am creating a portfolio for potential employers to see my work and choose me. I need to grasp the employers interests such as cost, time and skills. With these interests, they are more likely to choose me over someone without proof of work and such.

# Design
## Design 1

## Design 2
![Design2](/framework/src/images/Markdown/Design2.png)

## Why i chose Design 1 over Design 2
The first design is visually better compared to the second. It has more design features that show off my skills and capabilities. The look for the first is more professional looking, calm and easy on the eyes while it keeps a cool feeling.

## Firefox
![Firefox](/framework/src/images/Markdown/Firefoc.png)
## Chrome
![Chrome](/framework/src/images/Markdown/Chrome.png)

Between these 2 browsers, there is a height difference that squeezes chrome. There is also a notable size difference between the text and logo. Chrome becomes smaller and Firefox has bigger readability. Firefox would be better in terms of feedback received, this helps with reading, proportions and


# Timeline
* ## Designs
I have expected the design to take roughly 3 days, hours for revisions and redesign choices.
* ## Website
I expect to have the first 3 pages, Home, About Me and More by the 25th and carry on with other pages like skills, achievements and more.

# Content
This section is reasons why I added certain things into my website. Since this is mainly for employers sake, the things I cover are more leaned towards employablility such as skills, qualifications, etc.

## Main page
I added social media outlets for the purpose of past work to let employers see my work, this will pursuade employers to choose me over hiring someone without previous work.

## About Me
The about me section describes me and my aspirations, this will help employers to see my perosnality and my behaviour. In the section, I added a video on a design I made, It will show the employers my skills with photoshop, the image next to it shows that I am capable of building a PC, with a water cooling system. I added hyperlinks to some of my "Present" area, these go to my coding and game development projects showing my coding skills and capablites.

## Qualifications
Qualifications section shows the employers my English and Maths grades for their standard of hiring anyone for a position. This sets me apart from other applicants they have because they would prefer someone with a higher grade English or Maths than someone with a level 1 grade.

## Achievements
Achievements is to show how well I am doing in my current work and how proud I am to have the oppertunity, the employers will like the enthusiasm and the see the respect I have in a community. Unlike other applicants, I may have better achievements which the employer may prefer.

## Hobbies
Hobbies are a personal section, however, it is handy for employers to know the work I do is my hobby aswell, this is a very good insentive as no matter what, I am always learning to improve my craft and show no sign of stopping for the employer.

## Skills
Skills section goes over an array of my skills, this is from driving to being able to solve complex problems. This is to show the employer that I am able to travel for work, solve issues in their company and learn from my peers with ease. This gives me an edge over any other applicants they have in mind.

## Last page
The last page is just an email contact for the employer to directly contact me via email, I also added a support page for any minor issues they have or questions for me and a copyright page for all the legal things in my website such as icons, sounds, images, etc..

If the employer does like my portfolio and would like to hire me, it is very easy for them to find my contact which is at the top of the page and bottom.


# Evaluation
The design is awfully similar to the mock design. There were a few major changes like the About Me section having a complete re-design, instead of having slots with information in, I had a side paragraph as in the current design demonstrates. It taking too much space for any text to go in, so a re-design was needed, it looks much better than the previous design too as it is now sitting flush and not exceeding any box containers.

The website is fit for the purposes and meets the stakeholders and user requirements. pages load very fast within a second to keep the attraction of employers, if it was too long, they would reconsider choosing me as an viable applicant. The website is not hard to navigate, it is a simple scroll and view with no other linking pages, so it only requires one page to load for all my portfolio to be viewable. To me the website looks very professional and helps employers choose me. The website is very maintainable and less costly as it doesn't have so many pages with many CSS and HTML files everywhere but 2, copyright and the portfolio. 

Also, using the feedback from my peers, I had to change a few things from the original design, such as in Adam's feedback, he states that "skills page could lead into more depth." I decided to leave this for the commercial version as it will have much more content available for the employers later on.
