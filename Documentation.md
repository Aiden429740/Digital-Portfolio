# Targetted Audience
Employers, I am creating a portfolio for potential employers to see my work and choose me. I need to grasp the employers interests such as cost, time and skills. With these interests, they are more likely to choose me over someone without proof of work and such.

# Design
## Design 1

## Design 2
![Design2](/framework/src/images/Markdown/Design2.png)

## Why i chose Design 1 over Design 2
The first design is visually better compared to the second. It has more design features that show off my skills and capabilities. The look for the first is more professional looking, calm and easy on the eyes while it keeps a cool feeling.
